The news THEY don't want you to know

<h2 style="color:#00ff00;">They cannot silence the D1git1lFant0ms!</h2>
<p>Those <b>Abbies</b> and the <b>DOAC</b> are working <b>togther</b> now!

<p>Nice try, but you will never stop us. They tried to shut us down, but they will not silence <span style="color: #00ff00">D1git1lFant0ms</span>. They destroyed our old site but not to worry they will never decrypt what we have on them, we have it encrypted with Blowfish good luck cracking that!

<p>We lost all of our backups, they fried everything, they day of the Michael Jackson Verdict, coincidence? I think not, they are hiding something, they are covering up the truth! We will not rest until we know what they were hiding, and get our information back and distributed again. We will rebuild, if you have any of the old backups please send them to us, you know where to find us, I don't dare post it here, I'm sure they are watching.

<p>The ONLY way they could have broken though our firewall is if they were working together, so we now know for A FACT that the DOAC and the Abbies are allies, don't let them fool you, that's what they want! Only together could they have gotten though a Quad Xeon running at 3.2 GHz and 16 GB of RAM not to menton our SCSI RAID.

<p><b>THERE MUST BE SOMETHING REALLY BAD COMING SOON BUT WE ARE EVER VIGILANT</b>

<p>Be safe out there <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Hunters</b></span>, and don't fall for the Illuminati's traps
