<h2>Updates for Early June<br><span style="color:#00ff00;">- [2005-06-19] </span></h2>
<p>While H3x is trying to recover the old database, I am going to provide some news I have been passed along though the forums and emails. If you have any news or sightings, send them over to me: gh0stpr0t0cal aol.com <sub>(yes this is a working email)</sub>
<ul>
<li> Multiple sightings of <b style="color: #00aa00;">Bigfoot</b> are still being reported in the dense forests of Washington State. Witnesses described a large, ape-like creature moving through the woods. If anyone has any pictures please send them to me.</li>
<li> Several residents of Phoenix, Arizona, reported seeing strange lights in the night sky. The lights formed a V-shaped pattern and moved in unison, similar to the famous <b style="color: #00aa00;">Phoenix Lights</b> sighting in 1997.</li>
<li> A couple, who wish to remain unnamed, driving near Point Pleasant, West Virginia, reported seeing a large, winged creature with glowing red eyes. The description matched previous reports of the <b style="color: #00aa00;">Mothman</b>, a legendary creature said to haunt the area.</li>
<li> On June 1, 2005, a complex <b style="color: #00aa00;">crop</b> circle formation appeared overnight in a field in Wiltshire, England. I am trying to get some ivnestigators over in the UK to look into this, if anyone knows anything or has a contact there please have them get ahold of us.</li>
<li> More reports of <b style="color: #00aa00;">ghostly apparitions</b> at the <b style="color: #00aa00;">Myrtles Plantation</b>, including Chloe, a former slave who is said to haunt the property. I wish someone would put her to rest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Abbies are gathering and kidnapping people<br><span style="color:#00ff00;">- [2005-06-17] </span></h2>
<p>In the news out of Denver, North Carolina:</p>
<p>The Illuminati is trying to bury a story about a missing diner owner. He was reported missing by a waitress who worked with him, and get this, he went missing RIGHT after a convention of Abbies come through. The waitress reported to have heard "strange sounds" and saw strange people around right before, and she didn't mean the Abbies! We all know what happened, he got abducted, and they are covering up the truth. I don't know how they have such a strangle hold on the media, when will the sheeple wake up? Even WTW X seem to be softening up on them since the incident between Gemini and Sheldon Marie</p>
<p> Also in the news is the vampires making a deal with the guards at Gitmo. I knew something like this was going to happen. They cannot survive off of random encounters as toe Police State becomes more and more overbearing on the people. What other explainations are there for the deaths that are being leaked? After the suposed death of the Pope in April, I guess we know where they are hiding him in his undeath.
    <p style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Be safe out there <b style="color:#ff0000;">Hunters</b>, and don't fall for the Illuminati's traps

<h2>Those <b>Abbies</b> and the <b>DOAC</b> are working <b>togther</b> now!
<br><span style="color:#00ff00;">- [2005-06-14] </span></h2>
<p>Nice try, but you will never stop us. They tried to shut us down, but they will not silence <span style="color: #00ff00">D1git1lFant0ms</span>. They destroyed our old site but not to worry they will never decrypt what we have on them, we have it encrypted with Blowfish good luck cracking that!
<p>We lost all of our backups, they fried everything, they day of the Michael Jackson Verdict, coincidence? I think not, they are hiding something, they are covering up the truth! We will not rest until we know what they were hiding, and get our information back and distributed again. We will rebuild, if you have any of the old backups please send them to us, you know where to find us, I don't dare post it here, I'm sure they are watching.
<p>The ONLY way they could have broken though our firewall is if they were working together, so we now know for A FACT that the DOAC and the Abbies are allies, don't let them fool you, that's what they want! Only together could they have gotten though a Quad Xeon running at 3.2 GHz and 16 GB of RAM not to menton our SCSI RAID.
<p><b>THERE MUST BE SOMETHING REALLY BAD COMING SOON BUT WE ARE EVER VIGILANT</b>
<p style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Be safe out there <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Hunters</b></span>, and don't fall for the Illuminati's traps
