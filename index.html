<h2>The Abbies are gathering and kidnapping people<br><span style="color:#00ff00;">- [2005-06-17] </span></h2>
<p>In the news out of Denver, North Carolina:</p>
<p>The Illuminati is trying to bury a story about a missing diner owner. He was reported missing by a waitress who worked with him, and get this, he went missing RIGHT after a convention of Abbies come through.  The waitress reported to have heard "strange sounds" and saw strange people around right before, and she didn't mean the Abbies! We all know what happened, he got abducted, and they are covering up the truth. I don't know how they have such a strangle hold on the media, when will the sheeple wake up? Even WTW X seem to be softening up on them since the incident between Gemini and Sheldon Marie</p>
<p> Also in the news is the vampires making a deal with the guards at Gitmo. I knew something like this was going to happen. They cannot survive off of random encounters as toe Police State becomes more and more overbearing on the people. What other explainations are there for the deaths that are being leaked? After the suposed death of the Pope in April, I guess we know where they are hiding him in his undeath.

<h2>Those <b>Abbies</b> and the <b>DOAC</b> are working <b>togther</b> now!
<br><span style="color:#00ff00;">- [2005-06-14] </span></h2>
<p>Nice try, but you will never stop us. They tried to shut us down, but they will not silence <span style="color: #00ff00">D1git1lFant0ms</span>. They destroyed our old site but not to worry they will never decrypt what we have on them, we have it encrypted with Blowfish good luck cracking that!

<p>We lost all of our backups, they fried everything, they day of the Michael Jackson Verdict, coincidence? I think not, they are hiding something, they are covering up the truth! We will not rest until we know what they were hiding, and get our information back and distributed again. We will rebuild, if you have any of the old backups please send them to us, you know where to find us, I don't dare post it here, I'm sure they are watching.

<p>The ONLY way they could have broken though our firewall is if they were working together, so we now know for A FACT that the DOAC and the Abbies are allies, don't let them fool you, that's what they want! Only together could they have gotten though a Quad Xeon running at 3.2 GHz and 16 GB of RAM not to menton our SCSI RAID.

<p><b>THERE MUST BE SOMETHING REALLY BAD COMING SOON BUT WE ARE EVER VIGILANT</b>
